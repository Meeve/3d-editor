# 3D Editor

Maybe you know Blender? Blender is an open-source 3D Editor. I wanted to create a 
very basic version of it in WebGL and React. Purpose of this is to learn WebGL and 
having fun while doing it, because in my opinion programming graphics and doing 
animations is the best part of programming. Project is still in development.

### How to run

1. Clone this repo.
2. ```
   npm install
   ```
3. ```
   npm start
   ```
4. Open `localhost:8080` in your browser

### Panels with 3d scene

In this picture, you can see a running program. Panels that display them can be 
adjusted in any way you like. 

All views display the same scene, but from different perspectives. Panels can be
resized. By using green rectangle in the top-right corner, you can add more views, 
or delete already existing ones.

## Future features

### Lighting

Currently, I'm working on scene lighting. Demo of my work you can see on an 
attached screen. Every face of the presented cube is in single color.

### Animations

Even though animation view is accessible on `master`, it is still not finished yet.
