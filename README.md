# 3D-Editor

Maybe you know Blender ? Blender is an open-source 3D-Editor. I wanted to create very basic version of it in WebGL and React. Purpose of this is to learn WebGL and having fun while doing it, because in my oppinion programing graphics and doing animations is the best part of programming. Project is still being developed.

### How to run

1. clone this repo.
2. type npm install into console
3. type npm run start
4. enter localhost:8080

### Panels with 3d scene

On this picture you can see running program, which added 3 basic cubes. Panels that displayes them. Can be adjusted in anyway you like. All views display same scene buy from different angles. Panels can be resized and by using green rectangle at the top right corner, you can add more views, or delete already existing.
